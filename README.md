## How to work on it
1. If you want to use this code you can `cd` (in Terminal) to a fitting location and write/copy-paste following command

```
git clone https://github.com/saemyyy/weather-checker.git
```
2. After cloning the Repo you can open the Project **VSC** and a **New Terminal**
In the new Terminal you type following command to run the React App on a Server (where you can view live changes and use the app)
```
npm run dev
```
3. If it gives out an error you might have to install vite. Use following command in the VSC command line
```
npm install vite
```
run 2. again and start using the App by entering a location and checking the weather

**Please keep in mind that the app doesn't work without an api key**
